# Tech Support Website

This project is a university assignment to develop a user support website using Java Servlets. The goal is to create an interface and connect it to a servlet, then deploy the web application on a Tomcat server.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following main components:

- **tech-support-site/**: This directory likely contains the main source code for the web application, including servlets, JSPs, and other resources.
- **Servers/**: This directory may contain server configuration files or related resources.
- **.metadata/**: This directory is typically used by IDEs like Eclipse to store workspace-specific metadata.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used for developing servlets.
- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side scripting to enhance user interaction.
- **Apache Tomcat**: The application server used to deploy and run the web application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nissmoline/JavaWebApp.git
   ```

2. **Import the Project into Your IDE**:

   Import the project as an existing project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).

3. **Configure Tomcat Server**:

   Ensure that Apache Tomcat is installed and configured in your IDE.

4. **Build and Deploy**:

   - Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
   - Deploy the application to the Tomcat server.

5. **Access the Application**:

   Once deployed, access the application via `http://localhost:8080/tech-support-site`.

## Features
